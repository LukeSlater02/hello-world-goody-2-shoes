                <h3>Rome</h3>
                <p>
                    Arguably one of the most pivotal cities in ancient history, Rome's enduring influence spans 2,500 years from the legend of the first king Romulus and his defeated twin brother Remus, to Julius Caesar's Republic and the birth of the empire under Augustus.

                <h3>Florence</h3>
                <p>
                    Seat of the Roman Empire, leading light of the Renaissance and fervent advocate of la bella vita, Italy is renowned for its art, architecture, style and passion. Such is the depth of Italy’s cultural treasures, even the most modest church façade can hide work by the likes of Michelangelo. Our Italy specialists draw on their deep-seated connections with the country to help you unravel Italy’s well-known highlights, from Rome's ancient Colosseum to the untouched medieval towns of Tuscany and the lagoon city of Venice.

                <h3>Venice</h3>
                <p>
                    Canals, gondolas, and the Rialto Bridge. You think you know what to expect from Venice, but it turns out that no photo, however digitally enhanced, can hold a candle to the real city. To get to know it, though, requires more than an afternoon. While the day-trippers are stampeding from the Rialto to St Mark's Square, you should be a block or two away, watching artisans craft items with Renaissance techniques, seeing shimmering reflections dancing on bridge arches, and gawking at marble-clad buildings each more fantastical than the next. The joy of Venice is getting lost, they say – although however far you amble, you're never more than a couple of churches away from a Titian or Tintoretto.

                <h3>Naples</h3>
                <p>
                    The third-largest city in Italy is chock full of history, art, architecture and delicious food, yet it gets a bad rap for its crime and grime. While these blemishes are certainly a reality for residents, they're far from ubiquitous, especially where tourism is concerned. Choose to literally find higher ground at places like Certosa e Museo di San Martino and you'll be rewarded with truly spectacular views. Stroll the Via Caracciolo e Lungomare di Napoli or chat with the friendly locals and you'll start to experience some of the magic that this port city holds. And, of course, you can't forget the transcendence that comes from that first bite of Neapolitan pizza (in the city credited with inventing the pizza pie), nor that perfect sip of espresso.

                <p>
                    You can't judge a book by its cover, and you most certainly can't judge a city for its rough edges – doing so would make it easy to miss out on its real treasures, including underground frescos, royal palaces, Tuscan architecture and so much more.

                <h3>The Colosseum</h3>
                <p>
                    The Colosseum is arguably one of the most popular monuments in Rome, Italy. This ancient and awe-inspiring piece of architecture leaves visitors speechless while transporting them back to a time of Roman gladiators and crowds of cheering spectators. To get a taste of what it must have been like to join the crowd and watch gladiators fight to the death inside the amphitheatre, or simply to enjoy the atmosphere surrounding a famous monument, a visit to the Colosseum is an absolute must.

                <h3>Cinque Terre</h3>
                <p>
                    Tucked between Genoa and Pisa, along a mountainous and seductive six-mile stretch of the Italian Riviera, lie the Cinque Terre — five (cinque) traffic-free villages carving a good life out of difficult terrain. Each village fills a ravine with a lazy hive of human activity. Calloused locals and sunburned travelers enjoy the area's unique mix of Italian culture and nature. There isn't a Fiat or museum in sight — just sun, sea, sand (well, pebbles), wine, and pure, unadulterated Italy. While the region is now well-discovered and can get jam-packed, I've never seen happier, more relaxed tourists.

                <h3>The Pantheon</h3>
                <p>
                    The Pantheon is one of the most important sites and among the most popular attractions in Rome. It's so well-preserved that it offers great insight into the Roman Empire. It is also the site of the Renaissance painter Raphael’s tomb. Other notable people buried at the Pantheon include other Renaissance artists, Italian kings, and Margherita of Savoy. Anyone visiting Rome has to make time to visit the Pantheon. To make the most of your visit, it’s worth taking a guided tour of the Pantheon before the crowds arrive. Your expert guide will take you around the stunning building and will tell you everything you need to know about its history and significance. You’ll get to tour the Pantheon when it’s still quiet, and will get the chance to ask anything you’ve ever wondered.

                <p>
                    The Trevi Fountain, one of the most beautiful and famous fountains in all of Italy, is among Rome’s top tourist sites. Completed in 1762, after thirty years of construction, this stunning example of baroque architecture sits prominently in the Piazza di Trevi. There are numerous fountains in Rome, but none as large and opulent as the Trevi Fountain. Measuring 85 feet high, and 66 feet wide, the Trevi Fountain pours over twenty million gallons of water daily into its pool.

                    Leonardo da Vinci was a Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, inventor, military engineer and draftsman — the epitome of a true Renaissance man. Gifted with a curious mind and a brilliant intellect, da Vinci studied the laws of science and nature, which greatly informed his work

                <p>
                    Christopher Columbus was a navigator who explored the Americas under the flag of Spain. Some people think of him as the "discoverer" of America, but this is not strictly true. His voyages across the Atlantic paved the way for European colonization and exploitation of the Americas.

Upon reaching China, Marco Polo entered the court of powerful Mongol ruler Kublai Khan, who dispatched him on trips to help administer the realm. Marco Polo remained abroad for 24 years
