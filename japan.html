            <h3>Tokyo</h3>
            <p>Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic
                temples. The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The
                Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from
                classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo
                Museum).</p>

            <h3>Kyoto</h3>
            <p>Once the capital of Japan, is a city on the island of Honshu. It's famous for its numerous classical
                Buddhist temples, as well as gardens, imperial palaces, Shinto shrines and traditional wooden houses.
                It’s also known for formal traditions such as kaiseki dining, consisting of multiple courses of precise
                dishes, and geisha, female entertainers often found in the Gion district.</p>

            <h2>Landmarks</h2>
            <h3>Tokyo One Piece Tower </h3>
            <p>Indoor theme park for the popular Japanese manga series, One Piece. It opened on March 13, 2015
                inside Tokyo Tower. Since its opening, it underwent a partial renovation and reopened on June 18, 2016.
                It offered several games and attractions based on characters of the Straw Hat Crew from One Piece,
                entertainment shows, merchandise shops and themed restaurants, and seasonal events and campaigns.</p>

            <div class="column_break"></div>


            <h3>Unicorn Gundam Statue </h3>
            <p>Full-scale statue of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam from the series Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn installed
                outside Odaiba's DiverCity Tokyo Plaza, in Tokyo, Japan. It replaced a previous statue of the RX-78-2
                Gundam model.</p>
            <section class="straightImage"><img src="japanImages/gundamUnicorn.jpg" alt="Gundam"></section>
            <div class="column_break"></div>


            <h3>Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
            <p>Theres a distinct otherworldliness to the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, one youll feel as soon as you arrive
                and will stick with you long after you go. Located on the western edge of Kyoto, this bamboo forest is
                serene, secluded, and sprawling, making it the perfect spot to take a stroll and reflect. Its also the
                type of place youll struggle to do justice when you describe it to your friends back home. Even photos
                dont quite capture how special this place is.

                As you make your way through the grove, youll come upon the Nonomiya Shrine. This shrine may be modest
                in size, but it has a fascinating history that involves classic Japanese literature, imperial
                princesses, priestesses, ancient purification rituals, and more.</p>

            <div class="column_break"></div>

            <h3>Tokyo Skytreee</h3>
            <p>Japans tallest man-made structure, the Skytree holds a prominent spot along Tokyos skyline. It comes in
                at just under 2,100 feet and features two observation decks — each offering stunning views of the city
                and beyond. Remember when we said on a clear day you can see Mount Fuji from Tokyo? This is where youll
                find that view.

                The lower observation deck (the Tembō Deck) is a perfect spot for panorama lovers, as well as those
                feeling brave enough to walk across the glass-floor panels to take in the city below. Typically, we
                would suggest not looking down, but in this case, well make an exception.

                Higher up, youll find the Tembō Galleria. This is one of the highest observation decks in the world.
                For a truly memorable visit, make your way up to the Galleria after the sun goes down. Taking in Tokyo
                lit up in all its nighttime glory is a sight that will stick with you for a lifetime. </p>

            <h3>Himeji Castle</h3>
            <p>Hilltop Japanese castle complex situated in the city of Himeji which is located in the Hyōgo
                Prefecture of Japan. The castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese
                castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal
                period. The castle is frequently known as Hakuro-jō or Shirasagi-jō ("White Egret Castle" or "White
                Heron Castle") because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight.

                <p>Hirohiko Araki is a Japanese artist, best known for creating the long-running manga series JoJo’s

                    field. Following his high-school graduation, he began creating manga art full-time. He began his
                    career in 1983, with the one-shot manga titled Poker Under Arms. While his initial few mangas helped

                    Adventure, which became an international success, selling more than 100 million copies. Hirohiko

                    many more artists and even brands, such as Gucci, over the years. He also wrote a novel called Manga
                    in Theory and Practice, in which he spoke about his working method in detail.</p>
