                    <h2>Berlin</h2>
                        <p>The capital city of Germany is Berlin. Upon arrival, visitors have to forget anything they knew about a typical German city. Berlin is an assemblage of peoples and cultures, a historical and at the same time modern city. It also contains some of the finest examples of contemporary architecture in the country. The story of a whole nation is captured in the landmarks of Berlin, from the grandiose Brandenburg Gate to the 368m (1,200ft) TV tower at Alexanderplatz, offering one of the best views in the city.</p>

                        <p>Also notable is the magnificent Reichstag, the German parliament with its glass dome, which is open to the public for free. Berlin creates the latest trends in lifestyle, music and art, attracting creatives from all over the world and offering the largest independent music and theatre scene in Europe. A night out in Berlin is a must, as the city nights are long throughout the week, with a huge selection of cosy bars, clubs and live stages, especially around the areas of Kreuzberg and Neukölln.</p>

                    <h2>Cologne</h2>
                    <p>Cologne (or Köln), founded by the Romans, is one of Germany's oldest cities. The soaring Cathedral of Cologne is the centerpiece with dual towers reaching 157-meters into the sky and can be seen from all over the city. Located right next to the train station, it is the first things visitors see and they never take their eyes off it.</p>

                    <p>From here, walk through the old town and on the western shore of the Rhine River. Colorful 19th century houses and ice cream cafes are the background for an idyllic stroll. Cologne's art galleries and excellent museums mark every corner.</p>
                    
                    <p>After all that walking, Cologne provides the perfect refreshment. Kölsch is the beer of Cologne. Served in endless rotation in small glasses, the people of Cologne rarely drink any other beer.</p>

                    <h2>Munich</h2>
                    <p>Munich is known in Germany as München. It is the capital of Bavaria and gateway to the Alps. This quintessential German city is the land of lederhosen, giant schweinshaxe (ham hocks), and Oktoberfest. The people have their own proud accent, history, and traditions. Many Müncheners count themselves as Bavarian first, and German second. This is what most people think of when they think of Germany.</p>

                    <p>The city offers first-class museums and regal German architecture like Marienplatz and its famed glockenspiel, as well as the Nymphenburg Palace. Munich is fancy, but that doesn't mean the people don't know how to have fun. This is also the home of favorite locations like the English Garden.</p>
                    <p>It is said to be one of the most beautiful and charming cities in all of Germany and is filed with museums and beautiful architecture.</p>

                    <h2>Mount Zugspitze</h2>
                    <p>Mount Zugspitze is 2,962 m above sea level and although it’s a minnow compared to some mountains in the European Alps, it’s the ninth highest mountain in Europe and the highest mountain in Germany.</p>

                    <p>The mountain is part of the Wetterstein range, which is a chain of limestone peaks in the Bavarian Alps, bordering Germany and Austria.</p>
                    
                    <p>With three glaciers, 20 km of pistes and natural snow six months of the year, Mount Zugspitze is a magnet for those who love snow sports, but it also has plenty for those who don’t.</p>
                    
                    <p>The journey up the mountain itself offers panoramic views, starting with a cogwheel train ride from Garmisch-Partenkirchen to Lake Eibsee followed by a cable car ride to the top of Germany.</p>

                    <h2>Neuschwanstein Castle</h2>
                        <p>Few places on Earth look more like storybook illustrations than Neuschwanstein Castle. With its towers, turrets, frescoes, and throne hall, Neuschwanstein (or Schloss Neuschwanstein, as it is called in German) looks like it was plucked straight from your favorite fairy tale. But the story behind this over-the-top palace nestled in the Bavarian Alps is less idyllic.</p>

                        <p>King Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned the cliffside castle in 1868, just two years after Austria and Bavaria were conquered by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War (sometimes called the Seven Weeks' War), effectively stripping Ludwig II of his powers. He quickly retreated into a private fantasy world, surrounding himself with opulent castles where he could live out his dreams of being a true, sovereign king. However, he died before the castle was completed and never got to see the incredible finished product.</p>

                    <h2>Berlin Cathedral</h2>
                    <p>The Neo-Renaissance architecture of the Berlin Cathedral graces the city’s skyline and is a historical landmark in Berlin. Its grand architecture, with four towers and imposing dome that is almost 100 m high is a working Protestant church</p>
                    
                    <p>Berlin Cathedral started off as the court church for the rulers of Prussia, who later became Germany’s Emperors.</p>
                    
                    <p>Back then, the 15th-century version of the cathedral belonged to the Berlin City Palace.</p>
                    <p>The neo-classical architecture was introduced later and completed in 1905, during the rule of the last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II.</p>
                    <p>Damages during World War II meant a major restoration had to be done and the cathedral reopened in 1993.</p>

                <h2>Ludwig van Beethoven</h2>
                <p>
                    <p>Ludwig van Beethoven is considered one of the greatest musical geniuses that ever lived. His famous Symphony 5 is a beloved classic. He was a pianist and composer whose date and year of birth was shrouded in controversy- he believed to have been born in 1772 while records show that he was born in 1770. He may have taken his musical traits after his grandfather, also godfather, whom he was named after- Kapellmeister Ludwig van Beethoven was a popular musician in Bonn.</p>

                    <p>Beethoven, unfortunately, suffered under his father’s draconian methods training him to play the clavier and the violin- Beethoven’s dad had early on observed signs of a talent for the piano and wanted to harness this and make his son a prodigy like Mozart.</p>

                <h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
                <p>Albert Einstein is probably the most famous scientist of the 20th century.

                   <p>Einstein’s theory of relativity describes the dynamics of light and extremely massive entities, while his quantum mechanics concept whose subject is the subatomic realm make up the pillars of modern physics.</p>
                    
                   <p>For a man that achieved a lot in his lifetime and made a mark in his field, Einstein for sure surpassed the expectation that ‘never will he get anywhere’ as he was once told by his teacher.</p>
                    
                   <p>In 2005, Einstein had the year dedicated to the celebration of him, by a proclamation of it as the World Year of Physics by international physics organizations. Einstein published four papers in 1915 that had a major impact on the world of physics.</p>

            <h2>Angela Merkel</h2>
            <p>
                <p>Angela Merkel has been described as the most powerful woman in the world! She took office in 2005 becoming the first female Chancellor of Germany. With Germany being Europe’s largest economy thanks to her leadership through a financial crisis and back to growth, Merkel is Europe’s de facto leader.</p>

                <p>Merkel’s introduction to politics was in 1989 stemming from the Revolutions that took place in Germany at that time. She was the deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected East German Government.</p>

                <p>In her political career, Merkel has served as Minister of Women and Youth, Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, and General Secretary and Leader of her party.</p>

                <p>Merkel is renowned for her steely reserve and bold decisions.</p>
